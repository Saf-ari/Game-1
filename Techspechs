There is nothing about the difficulty of the game. Once you open the gate does the game end?


Program a background (I wasn't really given much. I don't know how the actual background and map should look)

Program the teachers/guards that move around the map.
  How do they interact with the students? Is it if the guards see the students or if they walk into them?
  Are the guards randomly moving or do their movements follow a pattern?
  At what speed do the guards move? How big are they?

Puzzles
  Are the puzzles randomly placed around the map or is there a certain puzzle per room? What even is a puzzle? Is it a question or is it like a minigame?

Minigames
  What are the minigames? Do you go to another screen to play them?

Student 1 (Sprite1)
  At what speed do they move?
  Code WASD for moving up, left, down, right
  Space means select
  Code "i" as a way for people to see the rest of the clues/hints they have discovered
  Have some array that stores all of the clues you have gotten

Student 2 (Sprite1)
  Code arrow keys for moving up, left, down, right
  Enter means select

Order of things to Code:
  Create the course/map of the game. Where do you go and how many rooms are there?

  Code the movements of the two students (variables: student1, student2)

  Code the movements made by the guards/teachers

  Code the interactions students have with guards. If the 

  Code the places where the students interact with the clues

  Code the minigames (I have no clue what this means but maybe just like have a cycle of 3 made up minigames that change screens when you interact with the clues)
    These minigames will likely take the most time and be hardest to program because they are a whole different interface.
  Code the way the clues are stored (Use an array to hold all of the clues and make sure you can access them by clicking "i")

  Code the final gate and figure out how the person wins the game
    Does the person just win, is there a screen that says "Winner!"?
