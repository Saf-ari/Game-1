There is nothing about the difficulty of the game. Once you open the gate does the game end?


Program a background (I wasn't really given much. I don't know how the actual background and map should look)

Program the teachers/guards that move around the map.
  How do they interact with the students? Is it if the guards see the students or if they walk into them?
  Are the guards randomly moving or do their movements follow a pattern?
  At what speed do the guards move? How big are they?

Puzzles
  Are the puzzles randomly placed around the map or is there a certain puzzle per room? What even is a puzzle? Is it a question or is it like a minigame?

Minigames
  What are the minigames? Do you go to another screen to play them?

Student 1 (Sprite1)
  At what speed do they move?
  Code WASD for moving up, left, down, right
  Code "i" as a way for people to see the rest of the clues/hints they have discovered
  Have some array that stores all of the clues you have gotten

Student 2 (Sprite1)
  Code arrow keys for moving up, left, down, right
