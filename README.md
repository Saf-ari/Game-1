# Game
Create a game where there are students trying to escape school and have to avoid the teachers/guards. Each level would be a different classroom. In each classroom is a guard/teacher that wanders around randomly with a flashlight. The room is pitch black. The students need to navigate throughout the room and find three codes located randomly inside the level. The final objective is to finish 10 levels and find all the codes to finally escape the school. As the level increases, the range of the flashlight increases, making it easier for the students to be detected. Also, the speed the guard moves increases as the level of increases. There are also obstacles in each level that is randomly located within the level. If the player gets close to the obstacle, it makes a sound that attracts the guard/teacher to move towards the obstacle. The number of obstacles increases as the level increases. 
The multiplayer mode will allow two players to play alongside each other. The controls for the first player is w(forward), a(left), s(back), d(right), and space(select). The controls for the second player is the arrow pad and enter(select). Pressing “i” will allow the player to view all the hints/codes they have collected. In multiplayer mode, there will also be two guards for each level instead of one.
At the end of the last level, the player must compile all the codes to spell out a randomly generated word that must be entered to allow the players to escape.
