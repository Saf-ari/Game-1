# Game
Create a game where there are students trying to escape school and have to avoid the teachers/guards. There are 10 levels in total. Each level would be a different square shaped classroom. In each classroom there are 3 guards/teachers that wanders around randomly with a flashlight. The guards move slightly faster than the player. The room is pitch black. There are desks and chairs around the room so that it acts as an obstacle so that the player will have to get around the desks and chairs. The students need to navigate throughout the room and find three codes located randomly inside the level. The final objective is to finish 10 levels and find all the codes to finally escape the school. When the player collects/walks over the paper shaped code, a letter that is part of a randomly generated 30 letter string is displayed on the screen, along with a number that displays the order of the letter in the string. As the level increases, the range of the flashlight that the guards carry increases, making it easier for the students to be detected. There are also random textbooks on the floor inside the room. If the player gets close (within radius of 2) to the textbook, it makes a sound that attracts the guard/teacher to move towards the obstacle. The speed of the guard doubles as they walk towards the book, and it is reset back to the original speed once the guard reaches the textbook. The number of textbooks inside each room increases as the level increases. If a teacher catches the player, the game ends. There is a timer on the top right hand corner of the screen that keeps track of how long it takes for the player to finish the game. Once the player exits the school, the timer stops and the game ends. The end screen displays the time it took for the player to complete the game on the middle of the screen and the best time is also displayed below it. The player can only view an area of a circle with the radius of 3 around the character. 

The multiplayer mode will allow two players to play alongside each other. The controls for the first player is w(forward), a(left), s(back), d(right). The controls for the second player is the arrow pad. The second player will also control a student. The number of clues per level will change to 6 in multiplayer mode. Pressing “i” will allow the player to view all the hints/codes they have collected. In multiplayer mode, there will also be two guards for each level instead of one. If a teacher catches one of the players, that player is unable to move until the next level. If both players are caught, the game ends. 

If the guards overlap/meet, the guards overlap and continue to move in the direction they were moving. If the guard encounters a wall, the guard randomly changes direction. 
The clues are located on the ground in the room and not on any object. 
The guards are double the size of the player character. The objects in the maze are the same size as the player character.
The clues are half the size of the player character. 

At the end of the last level, the player must compile all the codes to spell out a randomly generated string that must be entered to allow the players to escape. The screen is just a black screen that displays 30 lines where the player can type in the final string. The player can view the codes again by pressing i and viewing the inventory. The inventory
lists the codes in the order the player collected them. The player has 2 tries to enter in the correct code. If the player enters in the incorrect, the game ends and the player loses.
