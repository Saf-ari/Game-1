# Game
Create a game where there are students trying to escape school and have to avoid the teachers/guards. There are 10 levels in total. Each level would be a different classroom. In each classroom is a guard/teacher that wanders around randomly with a flashlight. The room is pitch black. There are desks and chairs around the room so that it acts as an obstacle so that the player will have to get around the desks and chairs. The students need to navigate throughout the room and find three codes located randomly inside the level. The final objective is to finish 10 levels and find all the codes to finally escape the school. As the level increases, the range of the flashlight that the guards carry increases, making it easier for the students to be detected. Also, the speed the guard moves increases as the level of increases. There are also random textbooks on the floor inside the room. If the player gets close to the textbook and knocks it down, it makes a sound that attracts the guard/teacher to move towards the obstacle. The number of textbooks inside each room increases as the level increases. If a teacher catches the player, the game ends.
The multiplayer mode will allow two players to play alongside each other. The controls for the first player is w(forward), a(left), s(back), d(right), and space(select). The controls for the second player is the arrow pad and enter(select). The second player will also control a student. The number of clues per level will change to 6 in multiplayer mode. Pressing “i” will allow the player to view all the hints/codes they have collected. In multiplayer mode, there will also be two guards for each level instead of one. If a teacher catches one of the players, that player is dead until the next level. If both players are caught, the game ends. 
At the end of the last level, the player must compile all the codes to spell out a randomly generated word that must be entered to allow the players to escape.
